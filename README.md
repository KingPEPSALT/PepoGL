# PepoGL
My first serious look into OpenGL and graphics.

## The future
Whilst PepoGL is still an interest of mine, another project, in many ways identical yet thematically different, has taken precedence. That project is the [FAR game engine](https://github.com/Compiler/Far-Game-Engine) that is currently being worked on with [@Compiler](https://github.com/Compiler) and [@MyGoodSir](https://github.com/MyGoodSir). 

Whether PepoGL will get completed I am unsure but if it does get completed it will be completely remade and will most likely take the form of an easy to use but high control graphics engine that allows beginners to C++ and experts of Graphics and game-dev to utilise OpenGL with healthy levels of abstraction.

And so if development is continued I will see it developed with the previously stated ideology and these goals in mind:

- Flexibility of control
    - Easy to use for beginners
    - Options for experts
- Healthy abstraction
    - Semantic and understandable classes
    - Does not affect performance
    - Room for memory management
- Usefulness
    - Will not simply be an OpenGL alias
    - Will not be a thin wrapper
    - Will have some innovative/useful functionality
